# Console Battle Simulator

This repository contains a console application that lets you witness thrilling battles between a hero and a monster.

## Key Features

- **Creature Base Class**: The program incorporates a core base class called "Creature" which serves as the foundation for hero and monster entities.

- **Rigorous Testing**: Every method within the program has undergone meticulous testing to ensure reliability and correctness.

- **Customizable Battle Functionality**: The battle functionality is designed as an interface named "BattleInterface." This means you have the flexibility to override and customize the battle logic by creating your own class that implements this interface.
